# Study_of_video_games_sales
Videogame sales were the subject of this case study. The dataset was downloaded from the Kaggle website. The dataset contains a list of video games that have sold more than 100,000 copies. In order to clean and reshape the data, I used Microsoft Excel, and then I visualized it using Microsoft PowerBi.

Fields includes :

Rank - Ranking of overall sales

Name - The games name

Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)

Year - Year of the game's release
